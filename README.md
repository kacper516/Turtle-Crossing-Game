It's a game based on "Crossy Road" game. Crossy Road is an arcade video game released on 20 November 2014. It was developed and published by Australian video game developer Hipster Whale, with the name and concept of the game playing on the age-old joke "Why did the chicken cross the road?"

You are a turtle, which want to get the finish without getting a collision with cars. Every levels cars go faster and faster, so the game is going to be harder. It's a simple example of this game.
